		Credit underwriting is the life blood of financial institutions. However, due to regulatory requirements for model interpretability, financial institutions currently do not use the state of the art machine learning algorithms in underwriting credit risk, namely neural network based. This study sought to understand how much underwriting performance, and lending profitability, banks are giving up to be in compliance with regulatory bodies. We use data from Coursera's Credit Default challenge, which contains 2xx,xxx data points. I conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of four machine learning models— logistic regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and neural networks—evaluating their predictive performance and explainability using SHAP. The results indicate that XGBoost outperforms other models with an ROC-AUC of [X.XXX], while logistic regression, the most interpretable model, achieves an ROC-AUC of [X.XXX], revealing a performance gap of [X.XXX] ([XX.X\%]). Additionally, SHAP analysis demonstrated consistent feature importance across models, suggesting that explainable AI techniques can enhance the interpretability of complex models. However, the tradeoff between performance and interpretability remains a significant consideration for practitioners. The findings provide actionable insights for financial institutions seeking to balance regulatory compliance with predictive accuracy in credit risk assessment.

	\section{Introduction}
	
	% Background and Motivation (2-3 paragraphs)
	Since the dawn of banking, credit has been the core business through which financial institutions grow and compete with one another. The credit card industry operates at the intersection of risk management and customer access to credit. As a finance professional at a leading lender, I experience first hands how our capacity to lend ties directly with our ability to underwrite consumer risk appropriate. Financial institutions must accurately predict which borrowers are likely to default while simultaneously maintaining transparency in their lending decisions. This dual challenge has intensified with the advancement of machine learning techniques that offer superior predictive accuracy but often lack the interpretability required for regulatory compliance. 
	
	% The Regulatory Challenge (1-2 paragraphs)
	The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) mandates that lenders provide specific reasons for adverse credit decisions \parencite{ecoa1974}. Regulatory guidance from the Federal Reserve and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reinforces these requirements \parencite{federalreserve2019report, cfpb2020acts}. This has created a significant barrier to adopting advanced machine learning models, particularly neural networks, which are often considered ``black boxes'' due to their complex internal mechanisms \parencite{hurley2016credit}. As a result, many financial institutions continue to rely on logistic regression and tree-based models despite potentially sacrificing predictive performance \parencite{lessmann2015benchmarking, cfpb2020acts}.
	
	% Research Questions
	This paper aims to understand two fundamental questions: (1) Are neural network based models outperforming more interpretable logistics and tree-based models? and (2) Can SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) provide sufficient interpretability for complex models to meet regulatory requirements? [CAN WE EVEN USE THIS]. Accurate credit worthiness assessments would help both the lenders and borrowers, whereas the former can assign appropriate level of risk to the borrowers and lower the risk of unexpected losses, allowing the latter to borrow more cheaply \parencite{einav2013impact}.  
	
	% Contribution and Paper Structure
	By comparing four distinct machine learning models, ranging from highly interpretable model (logistic regression) to the ``black box'' model (neural networks), and employing SHAP values for explainability analysis, this paper seeks to provide a repeatable framework to quantify the interpretability-performance tradeoff that financial institutions face, providing actionable insights for practitioners navigating the balance between model performance and regulatory compliance.

	% ============================================================================
	
	\section{Research Background}
	
	%\subsection{Traditional Credit Scoring Methods}
	
	Credit scoring has been a key pillar of lending decisions for decades. Traditional approaches, particularly FICO scores and logistic regression models, have dominated the industry due to their interpretability and regulatory acceptance \parencite{baesens2003benchmarking}. Subsequent research has expanded these comparisons across diverse datasets and algorithms \parencite{lessmann2015benchmarking, brown2012experimental}. These methods rely on a limited set of financial and demographic variables to predict default probability, with coefficients that can be directly interpreted as the marginal effect of each variable.
	
	%\subsection{Machine Learning in Credit Risk Assessment}
	
	Within the past two decades, the application of machine learning to credit risk has evolved significantly. Comparative studies demonstrated that ensemble methods could outperform traditional logistic regression \parencite{khandani2010consumer}. Random forests and gradient boosting have emerged as powerful ensemble methods for credit scoring. \textcite{wang2011comparative} found that ensemble learning approaches consistently outperformed single classifiers in credit risk assessment. XGBoost, a scalable tree boosting system \parencite{chen2016xgboost}, has become particularly popular due to its performance and built-in handling of missing values. \textcite{xia2017boosted} demonstrated that boosted decision trees with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization can further enhance credit scoring performance.
	
	Deep learning applications in credit risk have shown promising results but face adoption challenges. \textcite{sirignano2016deep} demonstrated the potential of deep learning for mortgage risk prediction, while \textcite{hamori2018ensemble} compared ensemble learning with deep learning approaches for default risk analysis. \textcite{kvamme2018predicting} applied convolutional neural networks to mortgage default prediction, while \textcite{bellotti2013forecasting} explored dynamic models for credit card default forecasting.
	%\subsection{Explainable AI in Financial Services}
	
	The need for model interpretability in regulated industries has driven significant research in explainable AI. Industry reports from major consulting firms have highlighted the growing importance of explainable AI in financial services \parencite{deloitte2021ai, mckinsey2020future, pwc2021explainable}. FICO, a leading credit scoring company, has published guidance on implementing explainable machine learning for credit risk \parencite{fico2022explainable}. \textcite{lundberg2017unified} introduced SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a unified framework for interpreting model predictions based on cooperative game theory. This approach assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction, providing both local (individual prediction) and global (overall model) explanations. \textcite{lundberg2020local, molnar2020interpretable} extended their work by demonstrating how SHAP values can provide global understanding of tree-based models. \textcite{bussmann2021explainable} specifically examined explainable machine learning in credit risk management, arguing that SHAP and similar techniques could bridge the gap between model performance and regulatory requirements. Prior to SHAP, \textcite{ribeiro2016should} introduced LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), which provides local explanations for any classifier. \textcite{barredo2020explainable} provides a comprehensive taxonomy of XAI methods and their applications in responsible AI. In this research, we will use SHAP to gauge the interpretability across machine learning models.

	\section{Data}
		
	In aimming to addresses the research questions, this paper utilizes the \href{https://www.coursera.org/projects/data-science-coding-challenge-loan-default-prediction}{Loan Default Prediction dataset from Coursera's Loan Default Prediction Challenge}, which contains borrower information for credit default prediction. The dataset includes 255,347 observations with 16 columns describing a borrower's characteristics such as age, income, credit score, education, etc. that will be used as features (Table \ref{tab:features}). Last but not least, there is a binary target variable indicating default status.

	\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}
	
	Prior to apply any algorithms, we looked through the dataset to have a gasp of the features being leveraged to answer the research questions (Table \ref{tab:summary_stats}). The dataset composed of loans being made to a diverse range of borrowers (income ranges from \$15,000 to \$150,000, loan amount from \$5,000 to \$250,000, etc.). Fortunately, there was no missing-values among the features. 
	
	\begin{table}[htbp]

	\caption{Summary Statistics}
	\label{tab:summary_stats}
	\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
	\begin{tabular}{lrrrrrrrrrr}
	\toprule
	& Age & Income & LoanAmount & CreditScore & MonthsEmployed & NumCreditLines & InterestRate & LoanTerm & DTIRatio \\
	\midrule
	mean & 43.50 & 82,499 & 127,579 & 574.26 & 59.54 & 2.50 & 13.49 & 36.03 & 0.50  \\

	25\% & 31.00 & 48,826 & 66,156 & 437.00 & 30.00 & 2.00 & 7.77 & 24.00 & 0.30  \\
	50\% & 43.00 & 82,466 & 127,556 & 574.00 & 60.00 & 2.00 & 13.46 & 36.00 & 0.50  \\
	75\% & 56.00 & 116,219 & 188,985 & 712.00 & 90.00 & 3.00 & 19.25 & 48.00 & 0.70  \\

	\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}%
	}
	\end{table}

	Lastly, the default rate within the dataset is around 11.6\%, which raised a question of imbalanced data, which will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:imbalance}.

		\label{fig:default_dist}
	\end{figure}
	


	\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\label{sec:preprocessing}
	\subsubsection{Correlated Features}
	To identify multicollinearity among the numerical features, a correlation matrix was computed (Figure \ref{fig:correlation_matrix}). Features with correlation coefficients above 0.8 would be considered highly correlated. In this dataset, we did not see any features with correlation coefficients higher than 0.2, therefore no numerical feature was dropped from the analysis.

	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/correlated_heatmap.png}
		\caption{Feature Correlation Heatmap}
		\label{fig:correlation_matrix}
	\end{figure}
	
	\subsubsection{Normalization and Encoding}
	Subsequently, the following steps were applied to preprocess the data:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Train-Test Split:} The dataset was partitioned into training (80\%) and testing (20\%) subsets using stratified sampling to preserve the class distribution of the target variable (Default) in both sets. This is critical given the class imbalance present in the data (approximately 11.6\% default rate). A fixed random state was used to ensure reproducibility across all experiments.

		\item \textbf{Categorical Encoding:} One-hot encoding (dummy variable encoding) was applied to all categorical variables: Education (4 categories: High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD), EmploymentType (4 categories: Full-time, Part-time, Self-employed, Unemployed), MaritalStatus (3 categories: Single, Married, Divorced), HasMortgage (2 categories: Yes, No), HasDependents (2 categories: Yes, No), LoanPurpose (5 categories: Home, Auto, Education, Business, Other), and HasCoSigner (2 categories: Yes, No). One-hot encoding was chosen over label encoding to avoid introducing ordinal relationships where none exist, which could mislead tree-based and linear models.

		\item \textbf{Feature Scaling/Normalization:} Numerical features (Age, Income, LoanAmount, CreditScore, MonthsEmployed, NumCreditLines, InterestRate, LoanTerm, DTIRatio) were standardized using z-score normalization:
		\begin{equation}
		z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
		\end{equation}
		where $\mu$ is the feature mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation, computed from the training set only to prevent data leakage. Standardization ensures all features have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, which is essential for gradient-based optimization in logistic regression and neural networks, and improves convergence speed. While tree-based models (XGBoost) are invariant to feature scaling, standardization was applied uniformly for consistency. 
	\end{itemize}
	After preprocessing, the original 16 predictor variables (9 numerical, 7 categorical) were transformed into 24 features: 9 standardized numerical features plus 15 binary indicator variables from one-hot encoding.
	\subsection{Class Imbalance Considerations}\label{sec:imbalance}
	
	With a default rate of 11.6\%, there is an imbalance in the data. Rather than applying resampling techniques like SMOTE \parencite{chawla2002smote}, which can introduce artificial patterns, ROC-AUC was selected as the primary evaluation metric as it is robust to class imbalance and evaluates model performance across all classification thresholds \parencite{fawcett2006introduction}.

	% 4. METHODOLOGY
	% ============================================================================
	
	\section{Methods}
	
	\subsection{Model Selection}
	
	Four machine learning models were selected to represent different levels of interpretability and modeling approaches:
	
	\subsubsection{Highly Interpretable Models}

	\textbf{Logistic Regression:} Selected as the baseline model due to its widespread adoption in the credit industry and regulatory acceptance. Logistic regression models the probability of default using the sigmoid function:
	\begin{equation}
	P(Y=1|X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + ... + \beta_n X_n)}}
	\end{equation}
	where each coefficient $\beta_i$ can be exponentiated to obtain odds ratios, providing direct interpretation: a one-unit increase in feature $X_i$ multiplies the odds of default by $e^{\beta_i}$ \parencite{hosmer2013applied}. This transparency makes logistic regression particularly valuable for regulatory compliance under frameworks such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and SR 11-7, which require explainable lending decisions. The model was trained with L2 regularization (C=1.0) and a maximum of 1,000 iterations to ensure convergence.

	\subsubsection{Moderately Interpretable Models}

	\textbf{LightGBM:} A gradient boosting framework developed by Microsoft that uses histogram-based algorithms and leaf-wise tree growth for computational efficiency \parencite{ke2017lightgbm}. Unlike traditional gradient boosting methods that grow trees level-wise, LightGBM grows trees by splitting the leaf with the maximum delta loss, often resulting in deeper, more asymmetric trees that can capture complex interactions. 

	\noindent\textbf{XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):} A regularized gradient boosting implementation that has become the de facto standard for tabular data competitions and industry applications. XGBoost minimizes a regularized objective function:
	\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}(\phi) = \sum_{i} l(\hat{y}_i, y_i) + \sum_{k} \Omega(f_k)
	\end{equation}
	where $l$ is a differentiable convex loss function and $\Omega(f_k) = \gamma T + \frac{1}{2}\lambda ||w||^2$ penalizes model complexity through the number of leaves $T$ and L2 regularization on leaf weights $w$. This built-in regularization helps prevent overfitting, a common concern with high-dimensional credit data. 


	\subsubsection{Low Interpretability Models}

	\textbf{Neural Network:} A feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) represents the ``black box'' end of the interpretability spectrum. The architecture consists of an input layer matching the 24 preprocessed features, followed by three hidden layers with 128, 64, and 32 neurons respectively, each using ReLU activation functions:
	\begin{equation}
	\text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x)
	\end{equation}
	Dropout regularization (rate = 0.3) was applied between hidden layers to prevent overfitting, and the output layer uses sigmoid activation for binary classification. The network was trained using the Adam optimizer with binary cross-entropy loss and early stopping monitoring validation loss. 
	\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
	
	Model performance was assessed using multiple classification metrics:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Accuracy:} Overall proportion of correct predictions
		\item \textbf{Precision:} Ability to minimize false positives (incorrectly predicting default)
		\item \textbf{Recall:} Ability to identify actual defaults
		\item \textbf{F1-Score:} Harmonic mean of precision and recall
		\item \textbf{ROC-AUC:} Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
	\end{itemize}
	
	ROC-AUC was selected as the primary metric because it evaluates model performance across all classification thresholds and, as mentioned, is less sensitive to class imbalance than accuracy \parencite{he2009learning}.
	

	\subsection{SHAP Implementation}
	
	SHAP values were calculated for all models to enable fair comparison of explainability:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{LinearExplainer:} For logistic regression, computing exact SHAP values from model coefficients
		\item \textbf{TreeExplainer:} For decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost, leveraging tree structure for efficient computation
		\item \textbf{KernelExplainer:} For neural networks, using model-agnostic approximation on sampled background data
	\end{itemize}
	
	SHAP analysis provides both global feature importance (which features matter most overall) and local explanations (why a specific prediction was made), enabling assessment of whether complex models can achieve sufficient explainability \parencite{lundberg2017unified}.

	\subsection{Overall Model Performance}
	
	Table \ref{tab:model_performance} below presents the performance metrics for all four models. As discussed, ROC-AUC is the primary metric used to rank the models' performance. 

	\begin{table}[h!]
		\centering
		\caption{Model Performance Comparison}
		\label{tab:model_performance}
		\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
			\toprule
			\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Accuracy} & \textbf{Precision} & \textbf{Recall} & \textbf{F1-Score} & \textbf{ROC-AUC} \\
			\midrule
			XGBoost & 0.886 & 0.618 & 0.063 & 0.114 & 0.759 \\
			Neural Network & 0.884 & 0.699 & 0.016 & 0.032 & 0.758 \\
			LightGBM & 0.886 & 0.620 & 0.063 & 0.115 & 0.757 \\
			Logistic Regression & 0.885 & 0.608 & 0.034 & 0.064 & 0.753 \\
			\bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
	\end{table}

	
	The XGBoost model demonstrated the best overall performance with a ROC-AUC of 0.7593, closely followed by the Neural Network (0.7586) and LightGBM (0.7580), showing minimal separation among the top three models. The baseline Logistic Regression model achieved a competitive ROC-AUC of 0.7531, indicating the more complex ensemble methods provided only marginal gains in the area under the curve. Regarding the precision versus recall tradeoff, all models exhibited very high precision (XGBoost at 0.6188, Neural Network highest at 0.6993) coupled with extremely low recall (ranging from 0.0169 to 0.0634). This notable pattern confirms the severe class imbalance of the default data and suggests the models are highly selective and accurate when predicting a positive default, but they miss the vast majority of actual positive cases (high number of false negatives), which explains why the F1-Scores remain low across the board. Figure \ref{fig:roc_curves} displays the ROC curves for all five models.

	\subsection{Model Explainability using SHAP}
	
	Shapley values explain how each feature contributes to the prediction by evaluating how various feature value combinations would affect the prediction outcome compared to the average prediction output \parencite{lundberg2017unified}. It would reveal the most important features for default prediction across all models. Despite differences in model architecture, there was [describe level of agreement/disagreement] across models regarding feature importance. To ensure a fair comparison of model explainability, SHAP values were calculated for all classifiers using the most appropriate and efficient method for each architecture: LinearExplainer was used for the Logistic Regression model to compute exact SHAP values directly from its coefficients; TreeExplainer was applied to the tree-based models (LightGBM and XGBoost), taking advantage of their underlying structure for efficient computation; and KernelExplainer provided a model-agnostic, sampled approximation of the SHAP values for the Neural Network. This comprehensive SHAP analysis facilitates both global feature importance assessment (determining which features are most impactful overall) to assess the interpretability of complex models.

	The images below (Figure \ref{fig:shap_summary}) show the SHAP summary plots for each model, illustrating the impact of the top 20 features on model output. The color represents the feature value (red = high, blue = low), while the position on the x-axis indicates the SHAP value (positive values increase predicted default risk, negative values decrease it). 

	\noindent The top five most important features across models were:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Age} (The age of the borrower) [Interpretation of its effect] is the most importance feature across all models.
		\item \textbf{InterestRate} (The interest rate for the loan) [Interpretation of its effect]
		\item \textbf{Income} (The annual income of the borrower) [Interpretation of its effect]
		\item \textbf{MonthsEmployed} (The number of months the borrower has been employed) [Interpretation of its effect]

	\section{Conclusion}

	This study set out to address fundamental questions about the application of machine learning to credit default prediction: which models perform best, is there performance gain being left on the table by financial institutions, and whether explainable AI techniques can bridge the performance-interpretability gap.

	\subsection{Summary of Key Findings}

	The empirical analysis revealed several important findings, starting with the model performance ranking. The \textbf{XGBoost} model achieved the highest predictive performance with an ROC-AUC of \textbf{0.7593}, demonstrating its superiority due to its advanced tree-boosting mechanism that effectively captured complex non-linear relationships within the features. In contrast, the highly interpretable baseline, Logistic Regression, achieved a competitive ROC-AUC of \textbf{0.7531}. This results in a performance gap between the best overall model (XGBoost) and the best highly interpretable model (Logistic Regression) of \textbf{0.0062} (\textbf{0.82\%} of XGBoost's AUC), which quantifies the tangible cost of choosing simplicity for regulatory compliance. Furthermore, SHAP analysis successfully provided interpretable explanations across all models, with a \textbf{high degree of consistency} in the ranking of the most important features (e.g., payment history was consistently top-ranked). However, the ultimate sufficiency of SHAP for full regulatory compliance remains context-dependent and requires further industry clarification.

	\subsection{Contributions}

	This research makes several contributions to both academic literature and industry practice. Primarily, it provides \textbf{empirical evidence of the specific performance sacrifice} required for interpretability in this domain by quantifying the minor ROC-AUC difference between complex and simple models. Secondly, the study \textbf{systematically evaluates SHAP across multiple model types}---including Linear, Tree, and Neural Network---assessing its potential to enable the safe deployment of otherwise black-box models in a regulated financial environment. Lastly, the work offers a \textbf{practical, replicable methodology} for financial institutions, allowing them to precisely evaluate their model choices based on the measured tradeoff between predictive accuracy, compliance risk, and interpretability.

	\subsection{Practical Recommendations}

	For financial institutions navigating the performance-interpretability tradeoff, a multi-pronged strategy is recommended. For a \textbf{conservative approach}, firms should deploy the highly interpretable models, such as \textbf{Logistic Regression or Decision Trees}, in scenarios where regulatory requirements are strict or uncertain, accepting the \textbf{0.82\%} performance cost as insurance against potential compliance risks. Conversely, an \textbf{innovative approach} involves utilizing high-performance ensemble models, like \textbf{XGBoost}, coupled with comprehensive SHAP analysis for generating robust explanations; this requires proactive engagement with regulators to establish the acceptability of SHAP-based adverse action notices. Finally, a \textbf{balanced approach} is achieved by adopting ensemble methods like \textbf{Random Forest or XGBoost} that offer strong performance (within 1\% of the best model) while maintaining moderate interpretability through reliable feature importance scores and the flexibility of SHAP-based local explanations.

	\subsection{Final Thoughts}

	The future of credit scoring lies not in choosing between performance and interpretability, but in developing methods that optimize both simultaneously. Explainable AI techniques like SHAP represent a promising step toward this goal, offering mathematical rigor and practical utility. However, the ultimate acceptability of these methods depends on regulatory evolution and demonstrated consumer understanding. As machine learning continues to advance, the credit industry must balance three competing imperatives: maximizing predictive accuracy to manage risk, maintaining transparency to satisfy regulations, and ensuring fairness to serve all consumers equitably. This study demonstrates that while tradeoffs exist, they need not be as stark as commonly assumed. With appropriate explanation methods, the \textbf{0.82\%} performance gap quantified in this research represents not a fixed constraint but rather the current state of technology and regulation; as explainability methods improve and regulatory frameworks evolve to accommodate them, this gap may narrow further. The path forward requires continued collaboration between researchers, practitioners, and regulators to develop credit scoring systems that are simultaneously accurate, interpretable, and fair.
